# Rental_Housing_Market
#This project allows users to collect information from rental market websites regarding the longitude, latitude, cost, sqft, # of #bathrooms and bedrooms, zip code, state and address.  Data can be scraped in two ways, either directly to 'datafile.csv' housed in the #data folder or to a database.  

#to create  simple SQLite database that will work with the 'scrapeToSQL' module, deploy the 'createSQLite.py' file in the 'data' folder.
#to use this program, run 'controller.py' with a list of the zip codes you would like to scrape.

#This program is written in Python V 2.7.
